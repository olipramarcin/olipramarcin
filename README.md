# 👋 Hey, I'm *deadshot*

## 🚀 What I'm building
- 💡 Currently hacking on: **TaskFlow**  
- 🔥 My playgrounds: backend, automation, scripts that save me time  

## 🧰 Tech stack
- **Luau** – main playground, I own it  
- **Python** – getting stuff done  
- **JS** – quick fixes, clean code later  
- **React Native** – basics, but I dive in when needed  
- **Flask** – warming up, soon dominating  

## ⚡ How I work
- 🏃 Fast prototyping > perfect code   
- 🐞 Debugging is my cardio  
- 💡 First make it work, then make it elegant  
- 🔄 Always iterate, always learn  

## 🎯 Goals
- 🚀 Level up in backend and systems  
- 🛠 Build stuff I’d actually use myself  
- 🌱 Learn more than I forget  
- 👥 Contribute to open source like a boss  
- 💻 Leave a trail of clean, usable code
